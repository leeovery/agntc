# Research: Agent Skills Installer (replacing Claude Manager)

Exploring technical feasibility of a standalone npx-based tool that installs AI skills, agents, scripts, and hooks from git repos into projects. Replaces the current Claude Manager (npm dependency + postinstall approach) with explicit commands and multi-agent support.

## Starting Point

What we know so far:
- Tech stack: TypeScript + @clack/prompts + commander
- Core commands: add, remove, update, list (via npx)
- Asset types: skills, agents, commands, hooks, scripts
- Source: git repos (not npm packages)
- Multi-agent: Claude, Cursor, Codex, Cline
- Vercel skill library is reference material but too narrow (skills only)
- Plugin repos should potentially self-declare what gets installed
- Name TBD (using "agentic" as placeholder)

## How Claude Manager Works Today

Convention-based discovery: scans for `skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `scripts/` directories in plugin packages. No config needed — just organize files in standard dirs.

Flow: `npm install plugin` → postinstall runs `claude-manager add` → finds plugin in node_modules → copies assets to `.claude/` → updates `.claude/.plugins-manifest.json`.

Manifest tracks: plugin name, version, list of copied files. Used for cleanup on remove/update.

Plugin repos declare nothing special — just include asset directories and depend on `@leeovery/claude-manager`.

### Limitations
- Tied to npm ecosystem (must be an npm package)
- postinstall hooks unreliable (npm 7+ preuninstall bug)
- Claude-only target directory
- No version pinning from git tags
- Can't install from arbitrary git repos

## Existing Plugin Structures

Three plugins exist today:

| Plugin | Skills | Agents | Scripts | Commands | References |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| claude-technical-workflows | 17 | 8 | 5+ | — | No (inline) |
| claude-laravel | 20 | — | — | — | Yes (6/skill) |
| claude-nuxt | 15 | — | — | — | Yes (2/skill) |

All use `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with: name, description, version, author.

Skills are either single SKILL.md files or directories with SKILL.md + references/.

## Vercel Skill Library Analysis

**What it does**: `npx skills add <package>` — installs skills from git repos. Supports GitHub shorthand, full URLs, GitLab, local paths. Creates symlinks or copies.

**Limitations discovered**:
- Skills only — no agents, hooks, or broader tooling
- Weak versioning (no semver, no lock files)
- 56% of eval cases: skill never invoked despite being available
- AGENTS.md (passive context) outperforms skills 100% vs 53%
- Vercel themselves now recommend AGENTS.md over skills for general knowledge
- No conflict resolution, no dependency management
- `allowed-tools` unsupported in many agents

**Key insight**: Vercel's own research shows passive context (AGENTS.md) outperforms on-demand skills. Our tool handles both paradigms — skills for task-specific workflows, but also agents/hooks/scripts that modify behavior more deeply.

## Design Decisions

### Asset Discovery: Convention-Based

Decision: Use convention — scan for known asset directories (`skills/`, `agents/`, `scripts/`, `hooks/`, `commands/`). No plugin manifest needed.

Rationale: Simpler for plugin authors. Just organize files in standard dirs. The tool knows what to look for and where to put it per agent. Initially considered manifest-driven but the complexity isn't justified — convention covers the real use cases.

### No Symlinks — Copy Only

Decision: Always copy files to the target directory. No symlink option.

Rationale: Vercel offers symlinks but notes they make updates harder. Copies are simpler — files are committed to git, versioned with the project, and work identically across environments (including Claude Code for web).

### Multi-Agent as First-Class Concern

Decision: Support multiple AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Cline, etc.) from the start.

Each agent has different target directories:
- Claude: `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, etc.
- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/`
- Others: TBD

Open questions:
- Auto-detect which agents are in use? (check for `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc.)
- Let user choose at install time?
- Could a plugin provide different assets for different agents?

### Two Repo Modes: Unit vs Collection

Repos can work in two ways, same convention at both levels:

**Unit mode** — repo root IS the package. Everything installs together as a cohesive unit:
```
repo/
├── skills/
│   ├── technical-planning/
│   └── technical-review/
├── agents/
│   └── task-executor.md
└── scripts/
    └── migrate.sh
```
Example: `claude-technical-workflows` — all skills/agents/scripts are interdependent, install as one.

**Collection mode** — each top-level directory is an independent unit. User interactively selects which to install:
```
repo/
├── laravel-actions/
│   ├── skills/
│   └── agents/
├── laravel-testing/
│   └── skills/
└── nuxt-components/
    └── skills/
```
Each subdirectory follows the same convention — has its own `skills/`, `agents/`, etc. User picks which directories to install.

Benefits:
- Same convention everywhere — a "unit" always looks the same
- Solves skill+agent dependency — co-located in the same unit, installed together
- Unit mode = simple, no choices. Collection mode = interactive selection
- A single repo can serve as a curated library of independent toolsets

Decision: Auto-detect which mode, prompt when ambiguous.

Rules:
1. Root has `skills/` or `agents/` directly → **unit mode** (install everything)
2. Root has subdirs containing `skills/` or `agents/` → **collection mode** (interactive pick)
3. Both patterns detected → **ask user**: "Install everything, or pick individual packages?"
