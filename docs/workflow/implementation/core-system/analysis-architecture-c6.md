AGENT: architecture
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation architecture is sound after five cycles of refinement. All previously flagged issues have been addressed: type safety at interfaces (AssetType, AgentId), centralized clone URL derivation with manifest-stored cloneUrl, driver-derived file ownership via identifyFileOwnership, unified update orchestration in update.ts, exhaustive failure mapping via mapCloneFailure/buildFailureMessage, and proper discriminated unions throughout. Module boundaries are clean, seam quality is good (collision checking and copy operations use compatible path formats), and the driver/strategy pattern composes well across all command flows. The remaining low-severity items from previous cycles (string[] in summary.ts agent parameters, redundant update re-check in list detail loop) are cosmetic and do not warrant re-flagging.
