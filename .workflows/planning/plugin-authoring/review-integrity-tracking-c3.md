# Review Tracking: Plugin Authoring - Integrity

## Findings

No findings. The plan meets structural quality standards.

All findings from cycles 1 and 2 have been resolved:
- Task 3-2 was removed and absorbed into task 3-1 (cycle 1)
- Task 3-1 now includes orchestrator wiring and cancel behavior (cycle 1)
- Task 3-3 has improved Do section with explicit file locations (cycle 1)
- Task 1-4 has acceptance criteria and test for unsupported type handling (cycle 1)
- Phase 3 task table reflects removed task 3-2 (cycle 1)
- All Phase 2 tasks now have Tests sections (cycle 2)
- Task 3-4 now has Tests section (cycle 2)
- Tick title for tick-7a71b4 matches plan.md name (cycle 2)

All 14 active tasks have complete template fields (Problem, Solution, Outcome, Do, Acceptance Criteria, Tests, Spec Reference). Vertical slicing is sound. Phase structure follows logical progression. Dependencies are handled by natural ordering within phases. Acceptance criteria are concrete and pass/fail. Task scope is appropriate for single TDD cycles.
