AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: No new standards issues found. All high and medium findings from cycles 1-3 have been addressed: update command uses resolveTargetKeys for collection prefix matching, config error messages include the spec-required "Invalid agntc.json:" prefix, computeIncomingFiles enumerates individual assets at correct granularity, summary output uses multi-line per-agent format with capitalized agent names, and direct-path tree URL @ref rejection was narrowed to path-only scope. Previously acknowledged low-severity items (undeclared cloneUrl manifest field, collection uniform agent selection with per-plugin warnings) remain unchanged from earlier cycles and are accepted trade-offs. Spec conformance is strong across all four commands (add, remove, update, list), type detection, driver architecture, manifest management, source parsing, collision/unmanaged handling, rollback behavior, update check semantics, agent compatibility changes, retry logic, error messages, and the list detail view action matrix.
