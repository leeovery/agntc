AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: No new standards issues found. All high and medium findings from cycles 1-3 have been addressed: update command uses resolveTargetKeys for collection prefix matching, config error messages include the spec-required prefix, computeIncomingFiles enumerates individual assets, summary output uses multi-line per-agent format, conflict-check pipeline is extracted, ExitSignal wrapper is in use, and list-update-action is unified. Previously acknowledged low-severity items (undeclared cloneUrl manifest field, tree URL @ref rejection breadth) and the accepted collection uniform agent selection remain unchanged from cycles 2-3. Spec conformance is strong across all four commands, type detection, driver architecture, manifest management, collision/unmanaged handling, rollback behavior, update check semantics, agent compatibility changes, and the list detail view actions.
