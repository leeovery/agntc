AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: No new standards issues found. All high and medium findings from previous cycles have been addressed: update command now uses resolveTargetKeys for collection prefix matching, config error messages include the spec-required "Invalid agntc.json:" prefix, computeIncomingFiles now enumerates individual assets at correct granularity, and summary output uses multi-line per-agent format with capitalized agent names. Previously identified low-severity items (undeclared cloneUrl manifest field, tree URL @ref rejection breadth) and the medium-severity collection uniform agent selection remain unchanged but were already acknowledged in cycles 2-3 as acceptable trade-offs given the spec's "warn, never block" principle. No new spec drift or convention violations detected.
