AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All findings from cycles 1 and 2 have been addressed: SKILL_MD_TEMPLATE extracted to shared templates.ts, ScaffoldResult unified in scaffold-utils.ts, Partial<Record> tightened to Record, writeConfigFile extracted to eliminate agntc.json write duplication, pathExists reused in pre-check.ts, and allowExcessArguments(true) removed. Command signature, prompt flow, file scaffolding content, skip-if-exists logic, reconfigure overwrite semantics, preview format, success messages, and agntc.json schema all match the specification.
