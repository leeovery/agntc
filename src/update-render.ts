 * intents), a bare label would merge two distinct groups' version info into one
 * indistinguishable line — a correctness bug — so each group disambiguates by
 * appending its intent: `@^1.2.3` (constrained caret), `@v2.0.0` / `@main`
 * (unconstrained exact-pin / branch), or the `@HEAD` sentinel for a HEAD-tracked
 * (`versionIntent === null`) group. Because `versionIntent = constraint ?? ref`,
 * the one suffix rule covers every case with no branch on `group.constrained`.
